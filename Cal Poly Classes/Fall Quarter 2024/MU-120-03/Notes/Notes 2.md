The Overtone Series
 - Pythagoras is also a big music guy, harmony and disharmony
 - Introduced ideas of intervals
 - Thought it had to do with connectedness of the universe

Harmonics
 - Caused by smaller vibrations "underneath" the fundamental harmonic
 - Follows a pattern that has been studied and documented
 - Major Triad is most pleasing to the human ear due to math and stuff

$\sqrt{5x+2}+12x-2^3$

$$ \sqrt{12x}$$



**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$


$$\int x^2 \, \sqrt{5} \ dx$$


$$\int_0^2 x^2\ dx = \frac83$$
